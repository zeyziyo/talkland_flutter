# Privacy Policy for Talkie

**Last updated:** 2026-01-09

Talkie ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application Talkie (the "App") handles your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Microphone Data
Our App requires access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`) solely for the purpose of speech recognition. 
- **Usage**: When you tap the microphone icon, your voice input is processed to convert speech to text.
- **Storage**: We do **not** store your voice recordings on our servers or your device permanently. The audio data is processed in real-time or sent to a speech-to-text service strictly for the purpose of translation and is discarded immediately after processing.

### Study Data
The App stores your study records (source text, translated text, and review history) locally on your device using an internal database. This data is not transmitted to any external server related to us.

## 2. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party services for speech recognition and translation functionalities (e.g., Google ML Kit, Android Speech Recognizer, or similar APIs). These providers may process data according to their own privacy policies.

## 3. Data Security
Since your study data is stored locally on your device, it is as secure as your device itself. We recommend keeping your device software updated.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
